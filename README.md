# Yahtzee--C-Program
This is code I wrote in C that plays a two player game of Yahtzee in my first Computer Science Class in College.

You probably will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 to play.

I have uploaded the files to github titled Ankerson_PA5(2). 
In order to play download the file and extract the contents.
Then open the first file titled Ankerson_PA5 and then open the file called PA5.sln and run without debugging.
